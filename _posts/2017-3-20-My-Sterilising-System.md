title: Baby Milk Sterilising System
---


Newborn babies do not do things when you expect them to. You might think you want to get them started on a nice routine of eating and sleeping, but they will have different ideas. I read somewhere that there’s not even any point trying to get them into a stable routine til you hit 3 months, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have some level of organisation in your life a bit earlier than that.

As The Baby was a bit small when he was born, and lost a bit more weight than he should have during the first weeks, we were giving the little fella top-up feeds after every boob session. Initially these were given with these [Aptimel pre-sterilised bottles](http://www.boots.com/aptamil-1-first-milk-starter-pack-ready-to-feed-6x70ml-10175040), whilst The Wife got the hang of pumping breast milk. Once she got going we had to clean bits of [pump](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Medela-Swing-Electric-Breastpump-Calma/dp/B000LPZTQY/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1490021594&sr=8-1&keywords=medela+swing) and [bottles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tommee-Tippee-Closer-Feeding-Bottles/dp/B001U3XVKC/ref=sr_1_4?s=baby&ie=UTF8&qid=1490021664&sr=1-4&keywords=tommee+tippee+bottles) and all sorts, so we became steriliser pros well earlier than we expected. And I was in charge, therefore there was a system. 




**The Equipment**

* [Washing up bowl](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ADDIS-touch-Washing-White-Grass/dp/B00DWZRZ3U/ref=pd_sbs_201_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JJP43TNPEBPC27CMYF43)
* [Steriliser](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tommee-Tippee-Closer-Electric-Steriliser/dp/B004GCJF9K/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby&ie=UTF8&qid=1490020913&sr=1-1&keywords=tommee+tippee+steriliser)
* [Drying Rack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Boon-Lawn-Countertop-Drying-Green-x/dp/B004OR1DTC/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1490020938&sr=8-1&keywords=lawn+drying+rack)
* Big tupperware

**The Process**

1.  When bottles or pump parts get used and need a clean, they get thrown in the washing up bowl. This is a separate bowl to the normal washing up bowl so that it remains uncontaminated by grease or food or whatever.
1. Before doing the main washing up in the evening, clean the bits in the bowl with warm and soapy using a special bottle brush. Rinse all the soapiness off and organise in the steriliser racks.
1. Put all the stuff in the steriliser and switch on
1. Do the normal washing up and the cat bowls whilst the steriliser runs (this step is not necessary to the system, just for me)
1. Once it’s finished, put the sterilised stuff on the drying rack, again this is separate to the normal washing up drying rack and is located in a low-traffic place in the kitchen.
1. When these things have dried (usually left overnight), assemble the bottles and dummies and place in the large tupperware. I actually have a separate tupperware just for the pump and one pump bottle so it can be moved around the house.
