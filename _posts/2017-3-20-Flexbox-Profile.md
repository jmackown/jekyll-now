title: "Responsive Profile Grid - Flexbox Version"
---

This is attempt 1 of recreating a very specific layout using a number of different grid layouts. My day to day tools for work are a bit more old fashioned, so I haven't really had an opportunity to play with grids to do anything complex. This is just a mockup of a specific part of our app that could do with a facelift in the future, so I am getting a headstart on investigating how.


The numbers should break down in order in smaller resolutions but jsfiddle is currently having a wobbly and not letting me save changes, so the order of 1,2,4,3,5 is correct.


The problem with this version, though it works, is it took a lot of manual work, and I ended up entering some random percentages as the flex-basis to make it fit, and I'm not sure why they work.
